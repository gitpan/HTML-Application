	* Release 0.38.
	
	* This release is the first one anticipating official registrations with 
	"The Perl 5 Module List".  The updated entry would look like this:

HTML::
::Application     adpO Framework for complex portable web apps      DUNCAND
	
	* This release contains the first appearance of my HTML::Application module.
	Its code is derived from several related modules which had been constantly 
	renamed, split, and combined since their first CPAN release in 2000-07-23.  
	The most recent temporary names for these were "CGI::WPM::Globals", 
	"CGI::WPM::PageMaker" and "CGI::WPM::WebUserIO".  They were previously 
	released as parts of the following distributions:
		- "libdwg": v1.0 r2000-07-23, v1.11 r2000-08-23
		- "CGI-FormGenerator": v0.9 r2000-09-04, v0.9201 r2000-12-26
		- "CGI-WebsiteGenerator": v0.3 r2000-09-04, v0.36 r2001-04-10
		- "duncand-prerelease": v0.37 r2001-04-12
	
	* This module requires Perl version 5.004.
	
	* It also requires File::VirtualPath 1.0, HTML::EasyTags 1.04, 
	Data::MultiValuedhash 1.07, and CGI::MultiValuedHash 1.07.  I consider the 
	first three modules to be stable and well tested, as well as unlikely to 
	change.  The fourth module is partially tested, but production use of the 
	other functionality finds it to be working properly.
	
	* This release comes with the CPAN standard files "Makefile.PL", "test.pl", 
	and "MANIFEST", which were all created since the previous release.

	* Note that "test.pl" is incomplete; it only tests that this module will 
	compile but not that the methods work; it is included so that people can use 
	the Makefile in the standard way during installation.  This file will be 
	fleshed out when I have the chance.
